🎯 2. Objectives

- Verify that users can search, view, and purchase books successfully.
- Ensure admin functions (add, edit, delete books) work correctly.
- Validate input fields and error handling for all user interactions.
- Confirm that the payment, cart, and order processes function end-to-end.
- Identify and log any defects affecting usability, functionality, or data integrity.

📋 3. Scope
✅ In Scope

- User registration and login
-Book search and filtering
- Shopping cart operations (add/remove/update)
- Checkout and order confirmation
- Admin book management
- UI validation (buttons, forms, messages)

🚫 Out of Scope

- External payment gateway API validation (Paystack server-side)
- Load and performance testing
- Multi-browser compatibility tests
- Full mobile responsiveness on all screen sizes

🧠 4. Test Approach

- Manual Black-Box Testing techniques were used:
- Equivalence Partitioning (EP): Valid/invalid input testing (e.g., coupon codes, prices)
- Boundary Value Analysis (BVA): Edge case limits (e.g., zero quantity, max value)
- Decision Table Testing (DTT): Discount and condition-based logic
- State Transition Testing (STT): Cart → Checkout → Payment → Order flow transitions
